    <div class="text3">
    <p>I suggest the game called gotcha force </p>

    <p>Great features of the game </p>
      <p>-Play with characters ranging from a cowboy, transformer, samurai to a gigantic dragon or humongous spaceship.</p>
      <p>-It's a gamecube game so it does not take a high powered computer to run the game.</p>
      <p>-Has a unique story of kids meeting toys from outer space in order to save their world.</p>
      <p>-Rated E for everyone so it is something kids could enjoy playing or watching as it has action without being too violent.</p>
